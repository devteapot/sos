# Progress ledger

This is the chronological index of verified SOS work. Detailed reports remain
in focused documents, but every meaningful experiment should add an entry here
in the same commit as its implementation.

## 2026-08-08 — Milestone 0: GPUI Mobile hardware gate

**Goal:** Determine whether the pinned community GPUI Mobile port is viable on
a physical ARM64 Android phone before designing the agent or provider system.

**Changed:** Added a reproducible wrapper around the unmodified upstream example
at GPUI Mobile commit `1d3ec2a1d14a` and Zed/GPUI commit `5688167d224b`.

**Evidence:** The example built, installed, and cold-launched on a Samsung
SM-A336B (API 35, Mali-G68 Vulkan). Touch, scrolling, IME text input, animation,
and ten pause/resume cycles passed. The 26 MB APK SHA-256 was
`4e470128b8e710c488063184fd6105ac60ae63356b6ce67acb6cef8c30c3736f`.
Full evidence is in [`experiment.md`](experiment.md).

**Decision:** Confirm GPUI Mobile for the next prototype gate, without treating
the pre-1.0 community port as production-ready.

**Open risks / next gate:** Native Rust rebuild/install latency remained too high
for conversational interface mutation. Compare interpreted runtimes and prove a
source-only change loop.

## 2026-08-08 — Runtime exploration: Luau, Rhai, and Flutter/Dart

**Goal:** Find an on-device execution layer that preserves GPUI as the native
host while avoiding a Rust/APK rebuild for ordinary interface changes.

**Changed:** Explored Luau through `mlua`, Rhai as a control, and Flutter Engine
+ Dart VM + Impeller as an alternate stack.

**Evidence:** On the target phone, a small Luau UI tree evaluated in about 88 µs.
The Rhai control compiled a deeper tree in about 127 µs and evaluated/validated
it in about 19 µs. Flutter hot reload remained development-host-driven and
Flutter would replace rather than script GPUI. A cached native Rust/package/
install/launch loop measured about 14.5 seconds. Detailed tradeoffs and primary
references are in [`runtime-evaluation.md`](runtime-evaluation.md).

**Decision:** Use Luau for the first vertical slice behind a runtime-neutral,
bounded UI IR. Keep Rhai as a credible fallback/control. Do not embed Flutter as
a GPUI scripting layer.

**Open risks / next gate:** Prove sandbox limits, transactional replacement,
state preservation, rollback, real touch behavior, and Android lifecycle safety.

## 2026-08-08 — Milestone 1: Luau → IR → GPUI vertical slice

**Goal:** Prove that one stable APK can accept a nontrivial experience revision
as source, interpret it on the phone, and safely accept or reject it.

**Changed:** Added the typed UI IR, fake weather/calendar/notes/music providers,
the bounded Luau runtime, a permanent GPUI Android host, app-internal accepted/
previous/rejected source storage, state persistence, and `sosctl` build, script,
and rollback commands. Added a light baseline and a dark card-free time-flow
experience.

**Evidence:** The time-flow source swapped into the running process in 6.571 ms.
Touch emitted `toggle_music`, persisted `{"playing":false}`, and removed the
playing-only control. Rollback completed in 2.215 ms without reverting state.
`adb install -r` preserved the exact source hash and state. Infinite-loop and
memory-bomb candidates were rejected while the accepted UI stayed live. Ten
pause/resume cycles retained the same PID. The final 34,567,587-byte APK for
commit `2314cff6d383` has SHA-256
`4c1943082fc5ec2c3680680e665b946b6097d90989fdc20a633427c4ee9216c8`.
Full results are in [`vertical-slice.md`](vertical-slice.md).

One important failure occurred: with `panic = "abort"`, interrupting Luau on
Android escaped as an uncaught C++ `lua_exception` and terminated the process.
Retaining unwind support made the same hostile candidate recoverable.

**Decision:** Confirm Luau + typed IR + stable GPUI host as the current prototype
architecture. The result proves source-only mutation, not a production sandbox.

**Open risks / next gate:** Move compile/evaluate work off the GPUI thread;
measure source-to-visible-frame p50/p95; run 1,000 swaps and 20 lifecycle cycles
with memory telemetry; reduce the roughly 7 MB APK delta; then extend the IR
only for concrete needs such as text input, images, animation, and accessibility.

## 2026-08-08 — Luau worker and 1,000-swap latency gate

**Goal:** Remove Luau compilation/evaluation from the GPUI thread and determine
whether repeated source mutation remains stable and conversationally fast on a
physical phone.

**Changed:** Added a dedicated worker that exclusively owns each Luau VM,
two-phase candidate prepare/commit messaging, asynchronous action handling,
per-stage timings, GPUI post-render confirmation, RSS sampling, and a
frame-paced `./tools/sosctl stress [count]` device harness.

**Evidence:** Android logs showed GPUI on `ThreadId(2)` and Luau on
`ThreadId(11)`. On the Samsung SM-A336B, 1,000/1,000 swaps completed in 18.150 s
with visible-frame p50/p95/p99 of 17.073/20.618/20.815 ms, a 29.803 ms maximum,
and 2.936 ms worker p95. RSS started at 274,016 KB, peaked at 274,080 KB, and
ended at 259,180 KB. A later infinite loop was rejected in the same PID without
changing the active-source hash, and 20 home/resume cycles kept that PID alive.
Seven runtime tests passed. The clean 34,678,451-byte APK from commit
`1c9cf464ed13` has SHA-256
`77265416cda78e12ec3b65ca6d9e912fbdb0d65bdb5a02fb8440916933b9b249`.
Full definitions, commands, caveats, and artifact identity are in
[`worker-stress-gate.md`](worker-stress-gate.md).

The first stress launch failed because an unescaped `&` in the deep-link URI was
interpreted by Android's remote shell. Escaping it produced a passing 10-swap
shakedown and then the full run.

**Decision:** Confirm the worker-owned Luau path. Source mutation no longer
executes Luau on GPUI's event-loop thread, and measured latency is below the
100 ms prototype threshold with substantial headroom.

**Open risks / next gate:** The visible signal is GPUI's post-render callback,
not an Android compositor timestamp; the 18-second RSS run cannot rule out slow
leaks; startup still waits for the initial worker tree. Extend the IR through
real text-input/IME, image, animation, focus, and accessibility experiences,
add longer soaks, and review process isolation before accepting untrusted
remote source.

## 2026-08-08 — Stateful generated experience and 10,000-swap gate

**Goal:** Prove that an agent can structurally rewrite a useful phone-like
experience while native input, focus, state, image, animation, semantics, worker
lifecycle, rollback, and visible-frame latency remain sound on hardware.

**Changed:** Added bounded keyed text-input and allowlisted image nodes, native
GPUI animation declarations, accessibility metadata, a cached GPUI input entity
with Rust-owned state shadowing, asynchronous cold worker startup, explicit
worker recreation, two structurally different daily-flow experiences, local
candidate validation, an agent-apply command, and sampled 10,000-swap telemetry.
The accepted source remains Luau data; GPUI, input, rendering, persistence, and
validation remain in the stable Rust APK.

**Evidence:** On the Samsung SM-A336B (API 35, ARM64), the final agent rewrite
validated as 5,130 bytes/37 nodes and reached a GPUI post-render callback in
15.858 ms without changing PID or JSON state; typing continued with the Android
keyboard still open. Rollback was visible in 15.302 ms and retained data. A
final-code 10,000/10,000 swap run completed in 172.646 s with visible p50/p95/
p99/max of 16.997/18.092/23.062/35.533 ms, worker p95 3.816 ms, RSS
289,268→281,088 KB, peak 294,432 KB, and zero positive delta. Five injected
keyboard taps landed during that run and the final coalesced event completed.
Twenty home/resume cycles retained PID/state and editing worked afterward;
Android automatically redisplayed the IME on 1/20 cycles, while a field tap
restored it on all others. Infinite-loop and memory-bomb candidates were
rejected without changing the accepted hash. `uiautomator` saw all six semantic
records in one window description. Fifteen workspace tests, formatting, clippy,
ARM64 packaging, install, launch, touch, submit, scroll, and native animation
checks passed. The clean 37,036,955-byte APK from implementation commit
`8687339234c5` has SHA-256
`c57255a3f3f42c320726cf4361c1ffffed131b3295f5e24333764fb69e31a372`.
Full commands and caveats are in
[`stateful-experience-gate.md`](stateful-experience-gate.md).

Three failures materially shaped the result. GPUI Mobile bypassed the generic
GPUI input handler for its Android keyboard, requiring a narrow character-
callback bridge. The first structural swap lost that callback despite retaining
the cursor, so commit now restores the active stable ID. The first long-soak
implementation left the final coalesced text event pending; draining it when
stress clears fixed the bug and the 10,000-swap run was repeated.

**Decision:** Confirm the smallest complete thesis for a trusted prototype. An
external coding agent produced a nontrivial GPUI composition; the phone
interpreted, validated, displayed, preserved state through, and rolled it back
without rebuilding the APK.

**Open risks / next gate:** The GPUI Mobile callback does not prove full marked-
text/non-Latin composition, accessibility is one coarse window node rather than
individually navigable elements, and a three-minute RSS run is not long-term
leak proof. Decide the untrusted-code process boundary, sign/revision source
delivery, add explicit state-schema migration, run an hours-long attributed
heap soak, and upstream or isolate the required GPUI Mobile platform changes.

## 2026-08-08 — Reassert the agent-native OS north star

**Goal:** Prevent the successful Luau/Android vertical slice from narrowing the
project into a scriptable app or closed declarative component system, and define
what “moving off Android” means in the original research vision.

**Changed:** Added [`vision.md`](vision.md) as the authoritative project goal and
linked it from the README and runtime decision. It defines the user experience,
provider-based replacement for visible applications, minimal fixed runtime,
durable revision artifact, immediate Luau and unrestricted native execution
tiers, target service architecture, staged AOSP transition, and measurable
Android-exit gate. Corrected the stateful-gate next step to prioritize generative
depth and autonomous revision engineering before production hardening.

**Evidence:** Re-read the initial design conversation. The defining user choice
was to avoid a preconfigured component catalog and allow the agent to write
dynamic implementation code—including component types, layout, drawing, hit
testing, navigation, behavior, dependencies, and shaders. The decisive example
was not a card rearrangement; it was a bent time axis with drag-to-attach
behavior that requires new geometry, interaction state, and a provider action.
The conversation also defined the permanent base as a minimal recovery
supervisor plus graphics/input/state/provider/build machinery, with immutable
source/binary revisions and eventually a privileged shell on the thin Android
hardware substrate.

**Decision:** Luau + typed IR remains the fast experimental path, not the final
component vocabulary. “Off Android” means SOS owns boot-to-experience, revision
supervision, provider/state services, input/surface routing, and composition on
AOSP/vendor foundations; it does not mean an ordinary Linux desktop port or an
immediate rewrite of the kernel and hardware stack.

**Open risks / next gate:** The current IR cannot express the decisive custom
interaction, `agent-apply` is still manually orchestrated, fake providers are
linked rather than reached through IPC, and swaps replace an in-process tree
rather than promote a complete candidate process/surface. Prove those four
properties with synthetic data before starting the privileged AOSP shell phase.

## 2026-08-08 — First Android-exit gate audit

**Goal:** Verify the five assumptions in the Android-exit gate using a reduced
single-shot agent requirement. Autonomous screenshot diagnosis and repair are
explicitly deferred.

**Changed:** Added bounded canvas path/quad commands, hit regions, pointer
coordinates, Android drag routing, typed provider effects, a JSON/TCP fake
provider daemon, and a reproducible headless `gpt-5.6-luna` medium command.
Added [`experience-api.md`](experience-api.md) and the full audit in
[`android-exit-gate.md`](android-exit-gate.md).

**Evidence:** The 12-test runtime suite and ARM64 build passed. A one-shot Luna
revision validated and appeared on the Samsung SM-A336B in 43.976 ms, but its
note was mostly outside the canvas hit bounds, so task-level first-pass success
failed. After one clearly attributed operator geometry correction and a mobile
touch-semantics bridge fix, a real drag emitted 29 updates, persisted attached
state, and caused a separate Mac `providerd` process to receive
`notes.attach_to_event`. A deeper 1,000-swap run accepted 1,000/1,000 in
64.441 s with 38.765/127.746/128.782 ms visible p50/p95/p99, 7.740 ms worker
p95, and +3,588 KB RSS. Twenty lifecycle cycles retained PID, source, state,
and provider receipt. The 37,242,259-byte dirty APK
`sos-experience-ed7669d9f777-dirty.apk` has SHA-256
`e74bb671f91b4597d1cfe095e25a3a43396e25516a44740191d5411a412f6c43`.

Two failures shaped the result. The first agent/harness contract accidentally
validated the same unchanged source twice; the wrapper now owns the sole
validation attempt. More importantly, GPUI Mobile deliberately withholds
`MouseDown` for scrolling gestures, so a desktop-style drag state machine never
started. Acquiring the source on the first `MouseMove` and suppressing canvas
scroll propagation fixed real-device drag handling.

**Decision:** Continue with Luau + GPUI, but do not leave the Android APK
laboratory. Gate A is partial, B and C fail, and D and E are partial. The
experiment confirmed the execution substrate while rejecting the claim that
the complete five-assumption exit condition has been met.

**Open risks / next gate:** Run a fresh untouched single-shot suite after
documenting viewport constraints; diagnose the 127.746 ms visible p95; build a
real candidate-process/surface supervisor with forced-crash rollback; remove
the linked provider fallback, externalize persistent state, implement schema
migrations and fault injection; then run a longer thermal/memory soak.

## 2026-08-08 — Freeze the raw single-shot evaluation protocol

**Goal:** Establish a reproducible lower-bound measurement for Luna medium
generation before adding a tailored prompt, skill, curated retrieval, repair
loop, stronger model, or fine-tuning.

**Changed:** Added six fixed requests spanning composition, conditional state,
custom geometry, safe phone hit regions, and a reachable provider effect. Added
a headless runner and deterministic Luau grader, documented in
[`raw-agent-evaluation.md`](raw-agent-evaluation.md). Raw generations and Codex
transcripts remain ignored artifacts; source hashes, token use, latency, and
scores are the durable evidence.

**Evidence:** `cargo check --locked -p runtime-luau --example eval_grade`,
`cargo fmt --all -- --check`, and `bash -n tools/eval-single-shot` pass. The
runner requires a clean tracked worktree and stops if the single-shot agent
touches tracked files. The frozen manifest is
`evals/raw-single-shot/cases.json`; no model outputs were inspected while
defining its checks.

**Decision:** Treat this as an intentionally weak baseline, not a forecast of
the mature agent. A valid compile alone is not success, and the deterministic
grader is necessary but not a substitute for selected physical-device visual
and interaction checks.

**Open risks / next gate:** Run all six cases, record the ignored suite artifact
hashes and summary, and audit representative results on hardware. Later compare
prompt/skill/retrieval and model variants against the unchanged suite. Consider
fine-tuning only after there is a useful accepted/rejected corpus and after
confirming support for the intended base model.

The first attempted run, `20260808-luna-medium-raw-v1`, stopped after one case
because `codex exec` inherited and consumed the case loop's piped standard
input. Redirecting Codex stdin from `/dev/null` fixed the runner. The partial
artifact is retained but is not a suite result; its sole 10,498-byte source
scored 5/5 and has SHA-256
`bbdcda53d511fffaebb72f7ab86ced58a2c6f03a00a40fa6f534a436f2bf8ce4`.

## 2026-08-08 — Android-exit gates B–D follow-up

**Goal:** Measure the raw six-case agent baseline, attribute the generated-
canvas latency tail, prototype process/surface crash recovery, and externalize
versioned state with migration and fault injection.

**Changed:** Added segmented source-to-frame telemetry; an isolated Android
candidate process/surface plus reproducible crash probe; a durable optimistic
state service with stage/promote/abort and four injected fault points; remote
state boot/action promotion; and a bounded Luau state migration contract.
Expanded the authoring contract with exact accessibility roles and the audited
phone viewport constraint. Full evidence is in
[`android-exit-followup.md`](android-exit-followup.md).

**Evidence:** Raw Luna medium v2 compiled 3/6 and scored 17/40 in 454.403 s,
using 659,981 input and 22,630 output tokens. Three identical unsupported-role
errors explain all compile failures; the drag result reached the typed provider
effect but failed safe geometry. A confirming physical-device 1,000-swap run
accepted 1,000/1,000 with visible p95 79.390 ms, worker p95 8.086 ms,
worker-to-commit p95 51.600 ms, GPUI tree-build p95 0.272 ms, callback p95
26.124 ms, and +3,748 KB RSS. Separate candidate PIDs `16995` and `17048`
failed before/after first frame while accepted PID `16889`, source, state, and
surface survived. The remote state envelope persisted across daemon restart;
phone-side before-promotion failure rejected state, while an ambiguous
after-promotion failure was reconciled by exact reload. Twenty-one Rust tests,
Java compilation, ARM64 build/install, and both candidate probes passed.
The final 37,256,773-byte dirty APK has SHA-256
`aacdc9fc8545ee008c8a542c1f3ff7f2928a688d13071204796e3d2031e0aa44`;
an exact-source after-first-frame smoke probe also retained accepted PID
`17754` after candidate PID `17861` died.

Direct process killing originally caused an Android restart loop; same-task
exceptions returned to the launcher; and an unhandled separate-task exception
showed Samsung's crash dialog. Isolating the candidate task and installing its
own uncaught-exception cleanup fixed the controlled probe. The raw evaluator's
first attempt also consumed its case-loop stdin; `/dev/null` isolation fixed it
before the authoritative v2 run.

**Decision:** The <100 ms latency gate passes and Luau/GPUI remain confirmed.
Do not move to privileged AOSP yet. Process recovery and provider/state
independence are meaningful partials, not complete gates.

**Open risks / next gate:** Replace the Java probe surface with a complete
GPUI/Luau candidate; keep the accepted experience interactive during build;
handle native process death from a fixed supervisor; remove the linked/local
fallback in the gate build; atomically bind migration, source, state, provider
effects, and surface promotion; coalesce drag state; then run the longer
thermal/memory soak.
